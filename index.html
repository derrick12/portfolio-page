          <h2> My Interests </h2>
          <h3>Learning New Technology</h3>
            <p>
              An example of new cool technology I'm currently interested in is Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. It has become an essential part of the technology industry.
              Research associated with artificial intelligence is highly technical and specialized. The core problems of artificial intelligence include programming computers for certain traits such as:
              <ul>
                <li>Knowlodge</li>
                <li>Reasoning</li>
                <li>Problem Solving</li>
                <li>Perception</li>
                <li>Leaning</li>
                <li>Planning</li>
                <li>Ability to manipulate and move projects</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Swimming</h3>
            <p>
              Another favourite thing I like doing is swimming. I find it fun and as a great way of keeping fit and well, making friends also.
            </p>
            <h3>Travelling</h3>
            <p>
              Well who wouldn't want to travel to places that you've only dreamt of!! Well, not me! I looove travelling! Not only do you get to visit new places, you achieve soo much more from learning new cultures, realeasing all that work tension and stress to creating lifetime memories.
